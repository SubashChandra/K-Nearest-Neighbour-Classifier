Implemented:

For each dataset:
	1-NN (Random Subsampling and 5-fold cross validation)
	3-NN (Random Subsampling and 5-fold cross validation)
	
2-d Plot for irisdata using sepalWidth and petalWidth
Plot of decison boundary using 1-NN

Note: Value of 'K' is generalized to test for various value of data
